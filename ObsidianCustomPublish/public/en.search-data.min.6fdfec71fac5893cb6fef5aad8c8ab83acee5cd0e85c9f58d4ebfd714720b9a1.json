Multiple search terms can be passed separated by a comma ,\nsize: Image size in the format \u0026lt;width\u0026gt;x\u0026lt;height\u0026gt;\nUser Functions\r#\rYou can define your own functions. Generally there are two types:\n1. Script user functions 2. Systemcommand user functions They can be invoked by:\ntp.user.\u0026lt;user_function_name\u0026gt;() Script User Functions\r#\rAllows to call Javascript functions from file and retrieve the return value. First you should define your scripts folder in the settings. You will then be able to call .js files from it. For further information about Javascript click here.\nThe function call name corresponds to the script name.\nScripts should follow the [CommonJS module specification](https://flaviocopes.com/commonjs/), and export a single function. In script user functions, you can still access global namespace variables like `app` or `moment`. However, you can\u0026#39;t access Eta scoped variables like `tp` or `tR`. If you want to use them, you must pass them as arguments for your function. System Commands\r#\rAllows you to execute system commands. This could be powershell, bash, cmd etc... To define it go to the Templater plugin settings and associate a function name with a working system function like curl or echo. You can define the desired shell binary in the settings too.\nYou can pass function arguments, which need to be js-Objects. They will be avaliable as environment arguments.\nNote that you can use internal Templater functions inside of System commands.\nThe invocation is under the namespace tp.user.*\nCommand Types\r#\rTemplater defines 3 types of opening tags, that defines 3 types of **commands**: \u0026lt;%: Raw display command. It will just output the expression that\u0026rsquo;s inside. \u0026lt;%~: Interpolation command. Same as the raw display tag, but adds some character escaping. \u0026lt;%*: JavaScript execution command. It will execute the JavaScript code that\u0026rsquo;s inside. It does not output anything by default. The closing tag for a command is always the same: %\u0026gt;\nIn addition there are two command utilities .\nDynamic commands\r#\rThey will be resolved upon entrance of the preview mode.\nTo declare a command dynamic add a plus sign after the opening tag. Like this:\n\u0026lt;%+ \u0026#34;command\u0026#34; %\u0026gt; Execution Commands\r#\rAllow to execute Javascript. They allow for global namespace variables.\nThe JS templating engine Eta allows for the return of execution functions to be parsed as a string which is stored in the variable tR.\nThis can be used for multiple purposes. You can append something to that string. This can be quite handy for debugging purposes.\nFor example, the following command: `\u0026lt;%* tR += \u0026#34;test\u0026#34; %\u0026gt;` will output `test`. There exist asynchronous functions in JS which. Add the await when needed. Whitespace Control\r#\rBy default, commands in Templater are not removing any newlines. Commands are replaced with their values and that\u0026rsquo;s it.\nIt can sometimes be useful to have some whitespace control after commands are inserted, which is exactly what this command utility offers.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s have an example. The following template:\n\u0026lt;%* if (tp.file.title == \u0026#34;MyFile\u0026#34; ) { %\u0026gt; This is my file! \u0026lt;%* } else { %\u0026gt; This isn\u0026#39;t my file! \u0026lt;%* } %\u0026gt; Some content ... Will produce the following output if the condition is false (the same happens when it\u0026rsquo;s true), notice the blank lines:\nThis isn\u0026#39;t my file! Some content ... You may want to remove the blank lines produced by the execution commands, that do not produce any output.\nA specific syntax exists for whitespace control:\nAn underscore _ at the beginning of a tag (\u0026lt;%_) will trim all whitespace before the command An underscore _ at the end of a tag (_%\u0026gt;) will trim all whitespace after the command A dash - at the beginning of a tag (\u0026lt;%-) will trim one newline before the command A dash - at the end of a tag (-%\u0026gt;) will trim one newline after the command. In our example, to fix our template to remove the blank lines, we would use the following template (notice the dashes - at the end of the tags), to remove the blank newlines after the execution commands:\n\u0026lt;%* if (tp.file.title == \u0026#34;MyFile\u0026#34; ) { -%\u0026gt; This is my file! \u0026lt;%* } else { -%\u0026gt; This isn\u0026#39;t my file! \u0026lt;%* } -%\u0026gt; Some content ... Which would produce the following output:\nThis isn\u0026#39;t my file! Some content ...

That\u0026rsquo;s the promise of modern digital note-taking tools. Think of it like a digital brain – a place where your ideas can live, grow, and connect with each other.\nYour Personal Information Sanctuary\r#\rIn our information-rich world, we\u0026rsquo;re constantly bombarded with interesting thoughts, insights, and discoveries. But how do we keep track of them? Traditional methods like scattered notebooks or endless computer files just don\u0026rsquo;t cut it anymore. We need a smarter way to manage our digital memories.\nMaking Connections That Matter\r#\rThe magic happens when your ideas start talking to each other. Imagine a tool that lets you create invisible threads between your thoughts – connecting a book quote to a work project, or linking a random insight to a long-term goal. It\u0026rsquo;s like creating a personal web of knowledge that grows more valuable over time.\nAccessibility is Key\r#\rGone are the days of being tied to a single device. Modern tools let you access your thoughts from anywhere – your phone, tablet, or computer. Your ideas are no longer trapped in one place but travel with you, ready to be explored or expanded at a moment\u0026rsquo;s notice.\nA Tool for Everyone\r#\rYou don\u0026rsquo;t need to be a tech expert to benefit from these digital tools. They\u0026rsquo;re designed to be intuitive, flexible, and adaptable to your unique way of thinking. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a student, professional, creative, or simply someone who loves collecting ideas, there\u0026rsquo;s a solution that can work for you.\nThe Power of Community\r#\rWhat makes these tools truly special is the community behind them. Imagine thousands of people around the world sharing clever ways to organize information, creating tools that make capturing and connecting ideas easier and more fun.\nYour Digital Journey Begins\r#\rYour collection of thoughts, ideas, and memories is unique – as individual as your fingerprint. These digital tools aren\u0026rsquo;t about creating complexity, but about making it easier to understand yourself, your work, and your world.\nRemember Wilder\u0026rsquo;s words: Your thoughts are treasures. It\u0026rsquo;s time to give them the home they deserve.\n[[2025-02-12-Wednesday]] \u0026raquo;\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/journal/2025-02-12-wednesday/","title":"2025 02 12 Wednesday","section":"Journal","content":"\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-11-Tuesday]] | [[2025-02-14-Friday]] \u0026raquo;\nAI Writing\r#\rHarnessing Light from the Wound\r#\r[!quote] The wound is the place where the Light enters you.\n— Rumi\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is at a crossroads, capable of either illuminating humanity’s greatest strengths or exploiting its deepest vulnerabilities.\nThe Core Tension: Decentralized Information vs. AI\u0026rsquo;s Centralizing Tendencies\r#\rYuval Noah Harari argues that the 20th century saw the rise of democracy, in part, due to its ability to leverage decentralized information flow. This fostered innovation and responsiveness, unlike authoritarian regimes that struggled with information control. However, AI introduces a critical shift, creating powerful centralizing forces that threaten this balance.\nData is Power\r#\rAI thrives on vast datasets, giving immense power to those who control them—governments and large corporations. This data concentration can undermine the decentralized information crucial for democracy, creating an uneven playing field where a few hold significant sway.\nAlgorithmic Control\r#\rAI algorithms can subtly manipulate populations through personalized information feeds, targeted advertising, and the spread of misinformation. This makes informed choices harder for citizens, eroding the foundation of democratic decision-making.\nErosion of Trust\r#\rAs AI sophistication increases, distinguishing real from fake information becomes increasingly difficult. This can lead to a general erosion of trust in institutions, the media, and even interpersonal relationships, fostering social and political instability.\nAI’s Power to Unite and Divide\r#\rAI is more than just a technological advancement; it is a force that can shape reality itself. As Harari argues in Nexus, information is not neutral—it has always been used to unite, organize, and sometimes control societies. Today, AI-driven misinformation threatens democracy by distorting public perception and eroding trust. To combat this, the United States and other global leaders must implement regulations to curb AI-driven manipulation and promote digital literacy, transforming AI into a tool for cohesion rather than division. Balancing Innovation and Ethical Responsibility\r#\rThe rapid expansion of AI must be paired with ethical oversight. Harari warns that in the pursuit of efficiency and profitability, AI risks entrenching biases, deepening inequalities, and making opaque decisions that lack accountability. Governments, corporations, and technologists must collaborate to create frameworks ensuring AI operates fairly, transparently, and in service of humanity’s well-being. Just as wounds can be sites of learning and transformation, the mistakes AI has already made should guide us toward more ethical development. AI as a Tool for Self-Correction\r#\rHarari emphasizes that AI has the power to amplify both the best and worst aspects of human nature. If left unchecked, it can be a tool for authoritarian control and mass surveillance. However, when harnessed responsibly, it can enhance creativity, mitigate biases, and support informed decision-making. Imagine AI being used to counter misinformation in real time, ensure fair hiring practices, and help individuals build knowledge networks. The key is in designing AI that prioritizes truth, accountability, and the betterment of society.\nCan Democracy Survive?\r#\rHarari doesn\u0026rsquo;t offer easy answers, but suggests democracy\u0026rsquo;s survival depends on addressing these challenges:\nTransparency and Accountability: Demanding transparency in AI system usage, particularly those influencing public discourse. Who owns the data? What are the algorithms designed to do? How are they used? Regulation: Carefully balancing regulation to prevent AI manipulation without stifling innovation. Education and Critical Thinking: Educating citizens about AI\u0026rsquo;s potential dangers and equipping them with critical thinking skills for the age of algorithms. Media literacy is crucial. Decentralization: Exploring ways to decentralize AI power through open-source technologies and diverse AI ecosystems. A Future Shaped by Choice\r#\rHarari’s insights remind us that AI is not inherently good or bad—it is a tool that will shape the world according to the values we embed within it. If allowed to develop without ethical guardrails, AI risks creating a world where truth is malleable, power is centralized, and human agency is diminished. But if we take proactive steps, we can turn this moment of uncertainty into one of enlightenment. As Rumi suggests, our wounds—our fears and vulnerabilities regarding AI—can become the very source of our strength, guiding us toward a future where AI serves humanity rather than subjugates it. The time to act is now, ensuring AI’s light shines in ways that elevate, rather than diminish, our collective human experience. The stakes are high. The future of democracy may well depend on it.\n\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-11-Tuesday]] | [[2025-02-14-Friday]] \u0026raquo;\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/journal/2025-02-14-friday/","title":"2025 02 14 Friday","section":"Journal","content":"\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-12-Wednesday]] | [[2025-02-19-Wednesday]] \u0026raquo;\nAI Writing\r#\rShine On: Embracing Your Value and Contributing to the World\r#\r[!quote] Yeah we all shine on, like the moon, and the stars, and the sun. — John Lennon\nIn the quiet moments of reflection, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to question our worth and the impact we can have on the world.

This digital repository, often managed through tools like Obsidian, promises to enhance productivity and creativity by externalizing our mental processes. However, a critical question arises: Is the use of a second brain merely an avoidant behavior that facilitates procrastination, or does it genuinely lay the groundwork for a robust knowledge foundation that yields long-term benefits?\nThe Procrastination Perspective\r#\rFor some, the meticulous organization of notes and ideas can become an elaborate form of procrastination. The act of setting up a second brain might serve as a distraction from immediate tasks, offering a false sense of productivity. This behavior aligns with the tendency to engage in low-priority activities to avoid more pressing responsibilities. The allure of perfecting a digital system can overshadow the actual application of the knowledge it contains, leading to a cycle where the tool becomes an end in itself rather than a means to an end.\nBuilding a Knowledge Foundation\r#\rConversely, when used effectively, a second brain can be a powerful tool for building a comprehensive knowledge foundation. By capturing and connecting disparate pieces of information, individuals can create a personal web of knowledge that supports deeper understanding and innovation. This system allows for the synthesis of ideas across different domains, fostering creativity and problem-solving. Over time, the accumulated insights and connections can lead to significant breakthroughs, both personally and professionally.\nStriking a Balance\r#\rThe key to leveraging a second brain lies in striking a balance between organization and action. It\u0026rsquo;s essential to ensure that the time spent managing the system does not outweigh the benefits it provides. Regularly reviewing and applying the stored information can prevent the tool from becoming a procrastination crutch. Additionally, setting clear goals and priorities can help maintain focus on the primary purpose of the second brain: to enhance productivity and facilitate meaningful work.\nConclusion\r#\rUltimately, whether a second brain serves as a procrastination tool or a knowledge foundation depends on how it is used. By consciously integrating it into daily routines and aligning it with personal and professional objectives, individuals can harness its potential to support long-term growth and achievement. The second brain should be a dynamic resource that evolves with its user, continually contributing to a deeper understanding of the world and oneself.\n\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-14-Friday]] | [[2025-02-20-Thursday]] \u0026raquo;\n"},{"id":12,"href":"/journal/2025-02-20-thursday/","title":"2025 02 20 Thursday","section":"Journal","content":"\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-19-Wednesday]] | [[2025-02-23-Sunday]] \u0026raquo;\nAI Writing\r#\rEmbrace Positivity: A Path to a Fulfilling Life\r#\r[!quote] Learn to listen. Opportunity could be knocking at your door very softly. — Frank Tyger\nIn a world where stress and anxiety seem to be the norm, the simple act of smiling can feel like a revolutionary act. Studies have shown that a positive outlook can increase lifespan by up to 35%. But is it really that simple? This essay explores the science-backed benefits of positivity, offering practical strategies to cultivate a more optimistic mindset and illustrating how a positive attitude can transform not only your own life but also the lives of those around you.\nThe Science of Positivity\r#\rResearch has consistently demonstrated the profound impact of positive thinking on health. For example, a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that optimists had a 77% lower risk of heart disease. Positivity affects the body by reducing the production of stress hormones like cortisol, which can weaken the immune system and increase inflammation. Furthermore, positive emotions trigger the release of endorphins, natural mood boosters that alleviate pain and promote a sense of well-being.\nCultivating a Positive Mindset\r#\rCultivating positivity requires conscious effort and consistent practice. Here are some actionable strategies:\nGratitude Practice: Start a gratitude journal and write down three things you\u0026rsquo;re grateful for each day. Be specific – instead of \u0026ldquo;my family,\u0026rdquo; write \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m grateful for my sister\u0026rsquo;s supportive phone calls.\u0026rdquo;\nMindfulness and Meditation: Use apps like Headspace or Calm to guide you through daily meditation sessions. Even five minutes a day can significantly reduce negative thinking.\nSurrounding Yourself with Positivity: Limit your exposure to negative news and social media content. Seek out friends and mentors who radiate positivity and inspire you to be your best self.\nPositive Self-Talk: When you catch yourself thinking negatively, challenge those thoughts. For example, if you think, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to fail this presentation,\u0026rdquo; reframe it as, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m well-prepared, and I can handle this.\u0026rdquo;\nSetting Achievable Goals: Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Achieving these small goals will provide a sense of accomplishment and boost your confidence.\nPracticing Self-Compassion: Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend. Acknowledge your imperfections and celebrate your strengths.\nEngaging in Activities That Bring Joy: Make time for hobbies and activities that you genuinely enjoy, whether it\u0026rsquo;s painting, hiking, or spending time with loved ones.\nThe Ripple Effect of Positivity\r#\rPositivity is remarkably contagious. Consider the story of a hospital janitor who always greeted patients with a smile and a kind word. His positive attitude not only brightened their day but also improved their overall experience, leading to better patient satisfaction scores. Similarly, a positive team leader can inspire their colleagues to work more collaboratively and creatively, resulting in higher productivity and a more positive work environment.\nOvercoming Obstacles with Positivity\r#\rLife\u0026rsquo;s challenges are inevitable, but a positive mindset can transform obstacles into opportunities for growth. Take the example of J.K. Rowling, who faced numerous rejections before her Harry Potter series became a global phenomenon. Her ability to maintain a positive outlook and persevere despite setbacks was crucial to her success. By viewing setbacks as temporary and surmountable, you can maintain motivation and achieve your goals.\nAddressing Counterarguments\r#\rIt\u0026rsquo;s important to acknowledge that positivity is not about ignoring negative emotions or pretending that everything is perfect. It\u0026rsquo;s about approaching challenges with a balanced perspective and recognizing that difficult emotions are a natural part of life. Emotional intelligence involves understanding and managing your emotions, as well as empathizing with others. It\u0026rsquo;s also worth noting that excessive positivity can be unrealistic or dismissive of genuine struggles. The key is to find a balance between optimism and realism, allowing yourself to feel and process negative emotions while maintaining a hopeful outlook.\nConclusion\r#\rEmbracing positivity is a powerful choice that can transform your life and the lives of those around you. By incorporating the strategies outlined in this essay, you can cultivate a more optimistic mindset, enhance your well-being, and navigate life\u0026rsquo;s challenges with greater resilience. So, take a deep breath, find something to smile about, and start spreading the positivity today. Your future self will thank you for it.\n\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-19-Wednesday]] | [[2025-02-23-Sunday]] \u0026raquo;\n"},{"id":13,"href":"/journal/2025-02-23-sunday/","title":"2025 02 23 Sunday","section":"Journal","content":"\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-20-Thursday]] | [[2025-02-24-Monday]] \u0026raquo;\nAI Writing\r#\rResilience and Hope: A Global Perspective on Positive Well-being\r#\r[!quote] Hope is an ontological need. — Paulo Freire\nIntroduction: The Complexity of Human Optimism\r#\rIn the remote highlands of Bhutan and the bustling streets of São Paulo, in the quiet meditation halls of Kyoto and the vibrant communities of rural Africa, human beings share a remarkable capacity: the ability to find hope in challenging circumstances. This essay explores the multifaceted nature of positivity, moving beyond simplistic self-help narratives to understand how different cultures cultivate resilience and emotional well-being.\nThe Anthropology of Hope\r#\rPositivity is not a universal, one-size-fits-all concept, but a complex cultural adaptation shaped by historical, social, and environmental contexts.

To realize one\u0026rsquo;s nature perfectly – that is what each of us is here for. — Oscar Wilde\nWe often find ourselves caught in the whirlwind of daily life, chasing external achievements and societal expectations. Yet, Oscar Wilde\u0026rsquo;s profound words remind us that the true purpose of existence lies within: the continuous journey of self-development. This essay argues that embracing self-development is not a selfish pursuit, but a fundamental responsibility that unlocks our potential, enriches our lives, and ultimately contributes to the betterment of the world.\nThe Untapped Reservoir of Potential\r#\rEach of us is born with a unique set of talents, passions, and capabilities – a masterpiece waiting to be unveiled. However, this potential often remains dormant, buried beneath layers of self-doubt, fear, and societal conditioning. Self-development is the process of excavating this inner treasure, honing our skills, and nurturing our growth.\nThe Transformative Power of Learning\r#\rAt its core, self-development is about continuous learning. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean formal education, but rather a commitment to expanding our knowledge and understanding of ourselves and the world around us. As highlighted in [[2025-02-11-Tuesday]], \u0026ldquo;Digital Treasures,\u0026rdquo; modern tools offer unprecedented access to information and opportunities for learning. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s mastering a new skill, exploring a different culture, or delving into a philosophical concept, each act of learning expands our horizons and enriches our lives.\nOvercoming the \u0026ldquo;Wound\u0026rdquo; Through Growth\r#\rSelf-development is not always easy. It often requires confronting our weaknesses, overcoming challenges, and stepping outside our comfort zones. As Rumi\u0026rsquo;s quote in [[2025-02-12-Wednesday]] suggests, \u0026ldquo;The wound is the place where the Light enters you.\u0026rdquo; It is through these struggles that we grow stronger, more resilient, and more compassionate. By embracing our vulnerabilities and learning from our mistakes, we transform our \u0026ldquo;wounds\u0026rdquo; into sources of wisdom and strength.\nThe Ripple Effect of Self-Improvement\r#\rThe benefits of self-development extend far beyond the individual. As we grow and evolve, we become better equipped to contribute to our communities, our workplaces, and the world at large. A person who is self-aware, confident, and skilled is more likely to be a positive influence on those around them. As [[2025-02-20-Thursday]] suggests, positivity is contagious, and by cultivating our own inner well-being, we create a ripple effect that inspires and uplifts others.\nThe Ethical Imperative of Self-Development\r#\rIn an increasingly complex and interconnected world, self-development is not just a personal choice, but an ethical imperative. As discussed in [[2025-02-12-Wednesday]], AI has the potential to be both a powerful force for good and a tool for manipulation. It is our responsibility to develop our critical thinking skills, our ethical awareness, and our capacity for empathy so that we can navigate these challenges and contribute to a more just and equitable world.\nEmbracing Your Inner Light\r#\rUltimately, self-development is about realizing our full potential and embracing our unique \u0026ldquo;light,\u0026rdquo; as John Lennon\u0026rsquo;s quote in [[2025-02-14-Friday]] reminds us. It\u0026rsquo;s about recognizing that we each have something valuable to offer the world and committing to the ongoing process of becoming the best version of ourselves.\nConclusion\r#\rOscar Wilde\u0026rsquo;s words serve as a timeless reminder that the aim of life is not simply to exist, but to thrive, to grow, and to become the masterpiece we were always meant to be. By embracing self-development, we unlock our potential, enrich our lives, and contribute to a brighter future for all. So, let us embark on this journey of self-discovery with courage, curiosity, and a unwavering commitment to realizing our true nature.\n\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-23-Sunday]] | [[2025-02-25-Tuesday]] \u0026raquo;\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/journal/2025-02-25-tuesday/","title":"2025 02 25 Tuesday","section":"Journal","content":"\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-24-Monday]] | [[2025-02-26-Wednesday]] \u0026raquo;\nAI Writing\r#\rThe Wellspring of Compassion: Why Self-Love is Essential for Loving Others\r#\r[!quote] Genuine love should first be directed at oneself; if we do not love ourselves, how can we love others? — Dalai Lama\nIn a world often focused on external achievements and relationships, the Dalai Lama\u0026rsquo;s words serve as a profound reminder: genuine love begins within. This essay explores the idea that self-love is not a selfish indulgence, but a foundational requirement for truly loving and connecting with others. Drawing upon previous discussions about resilience, positivity, and personal growth, it argues that cultivating self-compassion is essential for building meaningful relationships and contributing positively to the world.\nThe Foundation of Genuine Connection\r#\rThe Dalai Lama\u0026rsquo;s quote challenges the common notion that love is solely an outward expression. It suggests that our capacity to love others is directly proportional to the love we hold for ourselves. If we are filled with self-doubt, criticism, and negativity, these emotions will inevitably color our interactions with others. As explored in [[2025-02-20-Thursday]], positivity is contagious, but so is negativity. Therefore, cultivating self-love is not merely a personal benefit, but a way to ensure that our interactions with others are rooted in genuine care and compassion.\nOvercoming the \u0026ldquo;Wound\u0026rdquo; Through Self-Compassion\r#\rSelf-love is not about arrogance or self-admiration; it\u0026rsquo;s about self-acceptance and self-compassion. It involves treating ourselves with the same kindness and understanding that we would offer a friend. As Rumi\u0026rsquo;s quote in [[2025-02-12-Wednesday]] suggests, \u0026ldquo;The wound is the place where the Light enters you.\u0026rdquo; By embracing our vulnerabilities and imperfections, we open ourselves to growth and transformation. Self-compassion allows us to heal our \u0026ldquo;wounds\u0026rdquo; and emerge stronger, more resilient, and more capable of loving others unconditionally.\nThe Ripple Effect of Self-Love\r#\rWhen we cultivate self-love, we create a ripple effect that extends to all areas of our lives. We become more confident, more authentic, and more capable of pursuing our goals. As discussed in [[2025-02-14-Friday]], embracing our value and contributing to the world starts with recognizing our own inherent worth. When we love ourselves, we are more likely to take care of our physical and emotional well-being, leading to a healthier and more fulfilling life. This, in turn, allows us to be more present and supportive in our relationships with others.\nThe Ethical Imperative of Self-Love\r#\rIn an increasingly interconnected world, self-love is not just a personal choice, but an ethical imperative. As discussed in [[2025-02-12-Wednesday]], AI has the potential to be both a powerful force for good and a tool for manipulation. Similarly, our capacity for love can be used to uplift and empower others, or to manipulate and control them. By cultivating self-love, we ensure that our actions are motivated by genuine compassion and a desire to create a more just and equitable world.\nPractical Steps to Cultivate Self-Love\r#\rCultivating self-love is an ongoing process that requires conscious effort and consistent practice. Here are some actionable strategies:\nPractice Self-Compassion: Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend. Challenge Negative Self-Talk: Identify and challenge negative thoughts and replace them with positive affirmations. Set Boundaries: Learn to say no to requests that drain your energy or compromise your values. Engage in Activities That Bring Joy: Make time for hobbies and activities that you genuinely enjoy. Practice Gratitude: Focus on the things you appreciate about yourself and your life. Seek Support: Connect with friends, family, or a therapist who can provide support and guidance. Conclusion\r#\rThe Dalai Lama\u0026rsquo;s words offer a profound insight into the nature of love. By prioritizing self-love, we not only enhance our own well-being but also cultivate the capacity for genuine connection and compassion with others. Let us embark on this journey of self-discovery with courage, curiosity, and a unwavering commitment to realizing our true nature. By embracing self-love, we unlock our potential to create a more loving and compassionate world for all.\n\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-24-Monday]] | [[2025-02-26-Wednesday]] \u0026raquo;\n"},{"id":16,"href":"/journal/2025-02-26-wednesday/","title":"2025 02 26 Wednesday","section":"Journal","content":"\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-25-Tuesday]] | [[2025-02-28-Friday]] \u0026raquo;\nAI Writing\r#\rThe Struggle for Flow: Finding Center in Overwhelming Times\r#\r[!quote] Flow with whatever is happening and let your mind be free.

Our thoughts are not merely passive reflections of reality; they are active architects, shaping our perceptions, emotions, and ultimately, our destinies. To embrace a more fulfilling life, we must embark on a journey of cognitive transformation, challenging limiting beliefs, cultivating positive perspectives, and actively constructing a mindset that empowers us to thrive.\nThe journey begins with self-awareness. As the Dalai Lama suggests in 2025-02-25-Tuesday, genuine love and compassion for others stem from a foundation of self-love. This requires an honest assessment of our internal landscape, identifying the negative thought patterns and self-limiting beliefs that hold us back. Are we trapped in cycles of self-criticism, dwelling on past failures, or fearing future uncertainties? Recognizing these patterns is the first step toward dismantling them.\nOnce we become aware of our thought patterns, we can begin to challenge their validity. Often, our negative beliefs are based on distorted perceptions or outdated experiences. As explored in 2025-02-24-Monday, self-development involves continuous learning and a willingness to confront our weaknesses. By questioning the evidence supporting our limiting beliefs and seeking alternative perspectives, we can begin to rewrite our internal narrative.\nCultivating a positive mindset is not about denying reality or suppressing negative emotions. As discussed in 2025-02-20-Thursday, true positivity involves approaching challenges with a balanced perspective and recognizing that difficult emotions are a natural part of life. It\u0026rsquo;s about reframing obstacles as opportunities for growth, focusing on solutions rather than problems, and maintaining a sense of hope even in the face of adversity.\nThe concept of \u0026ldquo;flow,\u0026rdquo; as described by Chuang Tzu in 2025-02-26-Wednesday, offers a valuable framework for cultivating a positive and rewarding life. By accepting the present moment, embracing change, and finding joy in the process, we can tap into a state of effortless action and deep fulfillment. This requires a shift in perspective, from striving for external validation to finding intrinsic motivation in our endeavors.\nMoreover, as explored in 2025-02-23-Sunday, resilience is not about maintaining constant happiness, but about developing adaptive capacity. It is a dynamic, context-dependent process of navigating life\u0026rsquo;s complexities with creativity, compassion, and collective support.\nIn the digital age, the way we think is also influenced by the information we consume. As discussed in 2025-02-12-Wednesday, AI has the potential to be both a powerful force for good and a tool for manipulation. It is our responsibility to develop our critical thinking skills, our ethical awareness, and our capacity for empathy so that we can navigate these challenges and contribute to a more just and equitable world.\nUltimately, changing the way we think is not a one-time fix, but an ongoing practice. It requires a commitment to self-reflection, continuous learning, and a willingness to challenge our own assumptions. But the rewards are immeasurable: a life filled with purpose, connection, and joy. As John Lennon reminds us in 2025-02-14-Friday, we all have a light to shine. By transforming our thoughts, we can unlock our potential and illuminate the world around us.\nSome Links!\r#\rGoogle Products\r#\rGoogle Books: https://books.google.com Google Books Google Translate: https://translate.google.com Google Translate Google Calendar: https://calendar.google.com Google Calendar Google Maps: https://maps.google.com Google Maps Google Ads: https://ads.google.com Google Ads Google Drive: https://drive.google.com Google Drive VPN by Google One: https://one.google.com VPN by Google One Google Docs: https://docs.google.com Google Docs Google Images: https://images.google.com Google Images Google Videos: https://www.google.com/videohp Google Videos Google Finance: https://www.google.com/finance Google Finance Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com Google Scholar Google Analytics: https://analytics.google.com Google Analytics Google Sheets: https://sheets.google.com Google Sheets Google Developers: https://developers.google.com Google Developers Google Earth: https://earth.google.com Google Earth Google News: https://news.google.com Google News Gmail: https://mail.google.com Gmail Google Hangouts: https://hangouts.google.com Google Hangouts Google Toolbar: (Note: Google Toolbar is no longer available for download) (Note: Google Toolbar is no longer available for download) Google Cloud Platform: https://cloud.google.com Google Cloud Platform Google Account: https://myaccount.google.com Google Account My AWS Services\r#\rS3 storage: s3.amazonaws.com S3 storage EC2 instances: ec2.amazonaws.com EC2 instances RDS databases: rds.amazonaws.com RDS databases DynamoDB: dynamodb.amazonaws.com DynamoDB Lambda functions: lambda.amazonaws.com Lambda functions API Gateway: api-gateway.amazonaws.com API Gateway CloudFront: https://cloudfront.amazonaws.com CloudFront S3 Control: s3-control.amazonaws.com S3 Control Route 53: route53.amazonaws.com Route 53 Systems Manager: ssm.amazonaws.com Systems Manager CloudWatch: cloudwatch.amazonaws.com CloudWatch Elastic Beanstalk: elasticbeanstalk.amazonaws.com Elastic Beanstalk Redshift: redshift.amazonaws.com Redshift "},{"id":18,"href":"/journal/2025-03-01-saturday/","title":"2025 03 01 Saturday","section":"Journal","content":"\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-28-Friday]] | [[2025-03-02-Sunday]] \u0026raquo;\nDevelopment Documentation: Automated Hugo Blog Deployment with AWS Amplify Console (MVP)\n1.

How can I help you with your Obsidian vault today?\n[Timestamp: 2025/03/01 12:18:54]\nuser: help me improve this software architecture [Timestamp: 2025/03/01 12:19:28]\nai: Okay, I\u0026rsquo;ve reviewed the software architecture documentation for your automated blog deployment with AWS. Here are some suggestions for improvement, focusing on security, efficiency, and maintainability:\n1. Security Enhancements:\nS3 Bucket Access Control:\nCurrent: The document suggests a bucket policy allowing public read access using \u0026quot;Principal\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;*\u0026quot;. This is generally not recommended for security reasons. Improved: Implement CloudFront\u0026rsquo;s Origin Access Identity (OAI) to restrict direct access to the S3 bucket. This allows CloudFront to access the bucket, but prevents direct public access. Update the documentation to reflect this best practice. The bucket policy should then only allow access from the OAI. Documentation Update: Provide detailed steps on how to create and configure an OAI for the S3 bucket. IAM Role Permissions:\nCurrent: The document suggests using AmazonS3FullAccess and CloudFrontFullAccess initially. Improved: Emphasize the importance of creating custom IAM policies with the least privilege principle. Provide examples of more restrictive policies that only grant the necessary permissions to specific S3 buckets, CloudFront distributions, and actions. For example: // Example: Restricting S3 access to a specific bucket { \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;s3:GetObject\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;s3:ListBucket\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name\u0026#34; } ] } // Example: Restricting CloudFront invalidation to a specific distribution { \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;cloudfront:CreateInvalidation\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;arn:aws:cloudfront:::distribution/your-distribution-id\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;cloudfront:GetDistribution\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;arn:aws:cloudfront:::distribution/your-distribution-id\u0026#34; } ] } Documentation Update: Add a section on creating custom IAM policies with specific examples. Webhook Security:\nCurrent: The document mentions using a secret for webhooks and provides example code for verification. Improved: Reinforce the importance of using a strong, randomly generated secret. Consider using AWS Secrets Manager to store and manage the webhook secret instead of storing it directly in Lambda environment variables. This adds an extra layer of security. Documentation Update: Add a section on using AWS Secrets Manager for storing the webhook secret and update the Lambda function code to retrieve the secret from Secrets Manager. API Gateway Security:\nCurrent: Mentions API Keys and Throttling Improved: Add documentation on using AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) to protect the API Gateway endpoint from common web exploits. 2. Efficiency Improvements:\nLambda Function Optimization: Current: The Lambda function clones the entire Git repository on each deployment. Improved: Explore using Git sparse checkout to only download the necessary files (e.g., content, themes, config). This can significantly reduce the deployment time, especially for large repositories. Alternatively, investigate using a Git client library within the Lambda function for more fine-grained control over the cloning process. Consider Lambda Layers: If you have dependencies that don\u0026rsquo;t change frequently (e.g., boto3, requests), package them as Lambda Layers to reduce the size of the deployment package and speed up deployment times. Documentation Update: Add a section on optimizing the Lambda function for performance, including Git sparse checkout and Lambda Layers. CloudFront Cache Optimization: Current: The document suggests invalidating the entire CloudFront cache (/*) on each deployment. Improved: Implement more granular cache invalidation by only invalidating the specific files that have changed. This can significantly reduce the load on your origin (S3 bucket) and improve performance. You can achieve this by tracking the changed files during the Hugo build process and passing the list of files to invalidate to the CloudFront API. Documentation Update: Add a section on granular cache invalidation. Hugo Build Optimization: Current: The document assumes a standard Hugo build process. Improved: Explore Hugo\u0026rsquo;s build options to optimize the build process. For example, use the --gc flag to garbage collect unused resources during the build. Also, ensure that your Hugo configuration is optimized for production (e.g., minifying CSS and JavaScript). Documentation Update: Add a section on Hugo build optimization. 3. Maintainability Improvements:\nConfiguration Management: Current: The document suggests using Lambda environment variables for configuration. Improved: For more complex configurations, consider using a dedicated configuration management service like AWS AppConfig or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. This allows you to manage configurations centrally and update them without redeploying the Lambda function. Documentation Update: Add a section on using AWS AppConfig or Systems Manager Parameter Store for configuration management. Error Handling and Monitoring: Current: The document provides basic error handling and monitoring suggestions. Improved: Implement more robust error handling in the Lambda function, including detailed logging and alerting. Use AWS CloudWatch Alarms to automatically notify you of any errors or performance issues. Consider using a centralized logging solution like the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for more advanced log analysis. Documentation Update: Expand the sections on error handling and monitoring with more detailed examples and best practices. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Current: The document provides manual steps for setting up the AWS infrastructure. Improved: Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform. This allows you to define your infrastructure in code, making it easier to provision, manage, and version control. Provide examples of CloudFormation or Terraform templates for creating the S3 bucket, CloudFront distribution, Lambda function, and API Gateway. Documentation Update: Add a section on Infrastructure as Code with examples using CloudFormation or Terraform. 4. Diagram Improvement:\nThe current diagram is a good starting point, but it can be improved to show more detail. Consider the following: Add more detail to the Lambda Function box, showing the steps involved (e.g., \u0026ldquo;Clone Repo,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Build Hugo,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Sync to S3,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Invalidate Cache\u0026rdquo;). Add the Origin Access Identity (OAI) to the diagram to clearly show how CloudFront accesses the S3 bucket. If you implement API Gateway, add it to the diagram to show how the webhook triggers the Lambda function. Revised Mermaid Diagram Example (incorporating API Gateway and OAI):\ngraph LR A[Git Repository (GitHub/GitLab)] --\u0026gt; B(API Gateway) B --\u0026gt; C(AWS Lambda Function) C --\u0026gt; D{S3 Bucket} E[CloudFront] --\u0026gt; D E --\u0026gt; F[End User] subgraph Security E -.-\u0026gt;|Origin Access Identity| D end style D fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px Next Steps:\nPrioritize the security enhancements, especially implementing OAI for S3 bucket access and using AWS Secrets Manager for the webhook secret. Implement the efficiency improvements to reduce deployment time and improve website performance. Adopt Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to improve maintainability and version control. Update the documentation with detailed steps, examples, and best practices for each improvement. By implementing these suggestions, you can significantly improve the security, efficiency, and maintainability of your automated blog deployment pipeline. Let me know if you\u0026rsquo;d like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more specific examples.\n[Timestamp: 2025/03/01 12:19:44]\nuser: give me an outline for the entire documentation [Timestamp: 2025/03/01 12:20:07]\nai: Okay, here\u0026rsquo;s an outline for the entire documentation, incorporating the improvements we discussed, and restructuring it for better flow and clarity:\nDevelopment Documentation: Automated Blog Deployment with AWS\n1.

MVP Implementation Steps:\nBasic S3 Bucket Setup:\nCreate an S3 bucket. Enable static website hosting. Configure a temporary bucket policy for public read access (for initial testing only - this will be replaced by OAI in the next step): { \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Sid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;PublicReadGetObject\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;s3:GetObject\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Principal\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*\u0026#34; } ] } Upload your Hugo public directory content to the S3 bucket. Verify the website is accessible via the S3 bucket URL. CloudFront Distribution Setup:\nCreate a CloudFront distribution. Set the S3 bucket as the origin. Configure basic cache behavior (redirect HTTP to HTTPS). Set index.html as the default root object. Verify the website is accessible via the CloudFront distribution URL. IAM Role Creation:\nCreate an IAM role for the Lambda function.

Verify that the function clones the repository, builds the Hugo site, uploads the files to S3, and invalidates the CloudFront cache. Browse to your website via the CloudFront distribution URL to confirm the changes. Implement Origin Access Identity (OAI):\nCreate an OAI in CloudFront. Update the CloudFront distribution to use the OAI. Crucially, remove the public read access from the S3 bucket policy. Update the S3 bucket policy to allow access only from the OAI: { \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Sid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Grant CloudFront Access\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Principal\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;AWS\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;arn:aws:iam::cloudfront:user/CloudFront Origin Access Identity E1234567890123\u0026#34; // Replace with your OAI ARN }, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;s3:GetObject\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*\u0026#34; } ] } Test that the website is still accessible via CloudFront, but not directly via the S3 bucket URL. Git Webhook Integration (Basic):\nConfigure a Git webhook in your repository to trigger the Lambda function on push events. Important: For this MVP, you can use a simple API Gateway setup without webhook signature verification. This is not recommended for production, but simplifies the initial setup. Create an API Gateway endpoint. Integrate the API Gateway endpoint with your Lambda function. Use the API Gateway invoke URL as the webhook payload URL. Commit and push a change to your repository to trigger the deployment pipeline. Verify that the changes are deployed to your website. Basic Monitoring:\nMonitor the Lambda function execution in CloudWatch Logs.

Enable static website hosting. Configure a temporary bucket policy for public read access (for initial testing only - this will be replaced by OAI in the next step): { \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Sid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;PublicReadGetObject\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;s3:GetObject\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Principal\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*\u0026#34; } ] } Upload your Hugo public directory content to the S3 bucket. Verify the website is accessible via the S3 bucket URL. CloudFront Distribution Setup:\nCreate a CloudFront distribution. Set the S3 bucket as the origin. Configure basic cache behavior (redirect HTTP to HTTPS). Set index.html as the default root object. Verify the website is accessible via the CloudFront distribution URL. IAM Role Creation:\nCreate an IAM role for the Lambda function. Attach the following policies: AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess (for now - will be refined later) CloudFrontInvalidation (to invalidate the cache) AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole (for logging) Lambda Function Creation:\nCreate a Lambda function with the Python runtime.

Git Webhook Integration (Basic - GitHub Specific):\nConfigure a Git webhook in your GitHub repository to trigger the Lambda function on push events. Important: For this MVP, you can use a simple API Gateway setup without webhook signature verification. This is not recommended for production, but simplifies the initial setup. Create an API Gateway endpoint. Integrate the API Gateway endpoint with your Lambda function. In your GitHub repository: Go to Settings -\u0026gt; Webhooks -\u0026gt; Add webhook. Payload URL: Use the API Gateway invoke URL. Content type: application/json Secret: Leave this blank for now (for simplicity - do not do this in production!) Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?: Choose \u0026ldquo;Just the push event.\u0026rdquo; Active: Make sure the webhook is active. Click Add webhook. Commit and push a change to your repository to trigger the deployment pipeline. Verify that the changes are deployed to your website. Basic Monitoring:\nMonitor the Lambda function execution in CloudWatch Logs. The key change is in step 7, providing the specific steps for configuring a webhook in a GitHub repository. Remember to replace placeholders like your-bucket-name and the OAI ARN with your actual values. Also, remember that skipping webhook signature verification is a security risk and should only be done for initial testing.\n[Timestamp: 2025/03/01 12:23:56]\nuser: please create development documentation for the MVP product [Timestamp: 2025/03/01 12:24:18]\nai: Okay, here\u0026rsquo;s the development documentation tailored for the MVP version of your automated blog deployment pipeline on AWS, focusing on clarity, conciseness, and the essential steps:\nDevelopment Documentation: Automated Blog Deployment with AWS (MVP)\n1.

Project Setup \u0026amp; Configuration\nInstall Hugo: Download and install the Hugo static site generator. Follow the instructions for your operating system on the official Hugo website. Create a New Hugo Site: Use the Hugo CLI to create a new site: hugo new site your-site-name. This will create a basic directory structure for your Hugo project. Configure Hugo: Edit the config.toml (or config.yaml or config.json) file in the root of your Hugo project. Configure basic site settings like baseURL and title. Since we\u0026rsquo;re not using a theme, we\u0026rsquo;ll need to handle all styling ourselves. We\u0026rsquo;ll configure Hugo to output the bare minimum HTML structure. Set up Obsidian Vault: Create or designate an Obsidian vault to hold your website content. II. Content Creation in Obsidian\nWrite Content in Markdown: Create your website content as Markdown files within your Obsidian vault.\nUse Frontmatter: Add frontmatter to your Markdown files to define metadata like title, date, categories, tags, and any other custom fields. Example:\n--- title: \u0026#39;My First Post\u0026#39; date: 2023-10-27 categories: [\u0026#39;blog\u0026#39;] tags: [\u0026#39;hugo\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;obsidian\u0026#39;] --- This is the content of my first post. Organize Content: Organize your content within your Obsidian vault in a way that makes sense for your website\u0026rsquo;s structure. Consider using subfolders for different sections or categories.\nHandle Images and Assets: Store images and other assets in a dedicated directory within your Obsidian vault (e.g., assets). Link to these assets in your Markdown files using relative paths. For example: ![My Image](assets/my-image.png).\nIII. Integrating Obsidian with Hugo\nLink Obsidian Vault to Hugo: Decide how you will make your Obsidian content accessible to Hugo. There are a few options:\nOption 1: Directly within Hugo: Place your Obsidian vault (or a subset of it) directly within the content directory of your Hugo project. This is the simplest approach if you want Hugo to directly process your Obsidian Markdown files. Option 2: Symbolic Links: Create symbolic links from your Hugo content directory to the relevant directories within your Obsidian vault. This allows you to keep your Obsidian vault separate from your Hugo project while still making the content accessible to Hugo. Option 3: Scripted Copying: Write a script (e.g., using Python or Bash) to copy the relevant Markdown files from your Obsidian vault to the Hugo content directory. This gives you more control over the copying process and allows you to perform transformations on the content if needed. Configure Hugo to Process Markdown: Ensure that Hugo is configured to correctly process your Markdown files, including frontmatter and any Obsidian-specific syntax. You may need to adjust your Hugo configuration or use a custom Markdown renderer to handle certain Obsidian features. Since we\u0026rsquo;re not using a theme, this will involve creating custom layouts and templates.\nIV. Building and Deploying the Site with AWS Microservices\nBuild the Site: Run the hugo command in the root of your Hugo project to generate the static website files. This will create a public directory containing the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets for your site. AWS Setup: S3 Bucket: Create an S3 bucket to store your static website files (the contents of the public directory). Configure the bucket for static website hosting. CloudFront Distribution: Create a CloudFront distribution to serve your website content from the S3 bucket. This will provide caching and improve performance. Configure the CloudFront distribution to point to your S3 bucket. (Optional) API Gateway \u0026amp; Lambda: If you need any dynamic functionality (e.g., contact forms, search), you can create API endpoints using API Gateway and Lambda functions. These functions can interact with other AWS services like DynamoDB. Deployment: Upload to S3: Upload the contents of the public directory to your S3 bucket. You can use the AWS CLI or the AWS Management Console to do this. Invalidate CloudFront Cache: After uploading the files, invalidate the CloudFront cache to ensure that the latest version of your website is served to users. Domain Configuration: Configure your domain name to point to your CloudFront distribution. This will allow users to access your website using your domain name. V. Custom Styling and Layout (Since No Theme)\nCreate Custom Layouts: You\u0026rsquo;ll need to create custom layouts in the layouts directory of your Hugo project. This will involve creating HTML templates for your homepage, single pages, list pages, etc. Add Custom CSS: Create a static/css directory and add your custom CSS files to style your website. Link these CSS files in your HTML layouts. Consider a CSS Framework: To speed up development, consider using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS. You can include these frameworks in your project and use their classes to style your website. Hugo Pipes: Use Hugo Pipes to manage and process your CSS and JavaScript assets. This allows you to minify, concatenate, and transpile your assets for better performance. VI. Advanced Considerations\nObsidian Plugins: Consider using Obsidian plugins to enhance your content creation workflow. For example, you could use a plugin to automatically generate frontmatter or to export your notes in a format suitable for Hugo. Hugo Shortcodes: Use Hugo shortcodes to add dynamic content and functionality to your website. You can create custom shortcodes to embed videos, display data, or perform other tasks. Automated Deployment: Set up automated deployment using a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI). This will automatically build and deploy your website whenever you make changes to your Obsidian vault or Hugo project. You can configure your CI/CD pipeline to build your Hugo site and upload the contents of the public directory to your S3 bucket, then invalidate the CloudFront cache. This revised plan focuses on using AWS microservices for hosting and serving your website and eliminates the need for a pre-built theme. It emphasizes the need for custom layouts and styling.
