Multiple search terms can be passed separated by a comma ,\nsize: Image size in the format \u0026lt;width\u0026gt;x\u0026lt;height\u0026gt;\nUser Functions\r#\rYou can define your own functions. Generally there are two types:\n1. Script user functions 2. Systemcommand user functions They can be invoked by:\ntp.user.\u0026lt;user_function_name\u0026gt;() Script User Functions\r#\rAllows to call Javascript functions from file and retrieve the return value. First you should define your scripts folder in the settings. You will then be able to call .js files from it. For further information about Javascript click here.\nThe function call name corresponds to the script name.\nScripts should follow the [CommonJS module specification](https://flaviocopes.com/commonjs/), and export a single function. In script user functions, you can still access global namespace variables like `app` or `moment`. However, you can\u0026#39;t access Eta scoped variables like `tp` or `tR`. If you want to use them, you must pass them as arguments for your function. System Commands\r#\rAllows you to execute system commands. This could be powershell, bash, cmd etc... To define it go to the Templater plugin settings and associate a function name with a working system function like curl or echo. You can define the desired shell binary in the settings too.\nYou can pass function arguments, which need to be js-Objects. They will be avaliable as environment arguments.\nNote that you can use internal Templater functions inside of System commands.\nThe invocation is under the namespace tp.user.*\nCommand Types\r#\rTemplater defines 3 types of opening tags, that defines 3 types of **commands**: \u0026lt;%: Raw display command. It will just output the expression that\u0026rsquo;s inside. \u0026lt;%~: Interpolation command. Same as the raw display tag, but adds some character escaping. \u0026lt;%*: JavaScript execution command. It will execute the JavaScript code that\u0026rsquo;s inside. It does not output anything by default. The closing tag for a command is always the same: %\u0026gt;\nIn addition there are two command utilities .\nDynamic commands\r#\rThey will be resolved upon entrance of the preview mode.\nTo declare a command dynamic add a plus sign after the opening tag. Like this:\n\u0026lt;%+ \u0026#34;command\u0026#34; %\u0026gt; Execution Commands\r#\rAllow to execute Javascript. They allow for global namespace variables.\nThe JS templating engine Eta allows for the return of execution functions to be parsed as a string which is stored in the variable tR.\nThis can be used for multiple purposes. You can append something to that string. This can be quite handy for debugging purposes.\nFor example, the following command: `\u0026lt;%* tR += \u0026#34;test\u0026#34; %\u0026gt;` will output `test`. There exist asynchronous functions in JS which. Add the await when needed. Whitespace Control\r#\rBy default, commands in Templater are not removing any newlines. Commands are replaced with their values and that\u0026rsquo;s it.\nIt can sometimes be useful to have some whitespace control after commands are inserted, which is exactly what this command utility offers.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s have an example. The following template:\n\u0026lt;%* if (tp.file.title == \u0026#34;MyFile\u0026#34; ) { %\u0026gt; This is my file! \u0026lt;%* } else { %\u0026gt; This isn\u0026#39;t my file! \u0026lt;%* } %\u0026gt; Some content ... Will produce the following output if the condition is false (the same happens when it\u0026rsquo;s true), notice the blank lines:\nThis isn\u0026#39;t my file! Some content ... You may want to remove the blank lines produced by the execution commands, that do not produce any output.\nA specific syntax exists for whitespace control:\nAn underscore _ at the beginning of a tag (\u0026lt;%_) will trim all whitespace before the command An underscore _ at the end of a tag (_%\u0026gt;) will trim all whitespace after the command A dash - at the beginning of a tag (\u0026lt;%-) will trim one newline before the command A dash - at the end of a tag (-%\u0026gt;) will trim one newline after the command. In our example, to fix our template to remove the blank lines, we would use the following template (notice the dashes - at the end of the tags), to remove the blank newlines after the execution commands:\n\u0026lt;%* if (tp.file.title == \u0026#34;MyFile\u0026#34; ) { -%\u0026gt; This is my file! \u0026lt;%* } else { -%\u0026gt; This isn\u0026#39;t my file! \u0026lt;%* } -%\u0026gt; Some content ... Which would produce the following output:\nThis isn\u0026#39;t my file! Some content ...

That\u0026rsquo;s the promise of modern digital note-taking tools. Think of it like a digital brain ‚Äì a place where your ideas can live, grow, and connect with each other.\nYour Personal Information Sanctuary\r#\rIn our information-rich world, we\u0026rsquo;re constantly bombarded with interesting thoughts, insights, and discoveries. But how do we keep track of them? Traditional methods like scattered notebooks or endless computer files just don\u0026rsquo;t cut it anymore. We need a smarter way to manage our digital memories.\nMaking Connections That Matter\r#\rThe magic happens when your ideas start talking to each other. Imagine a tool that lets you create invisible threads between your thoughts ‚Äì connecting a book quote to a work project, or linking a random insight to a long-term goal. It\u0026rsquo;s like creating a personal web of knowledge that grows more valuable over time.\nAccessibility is Key\r#\rGone are the days of being tied to a single device. Modern tools let you access your thoughts from anywhere ‚Äì your phone, tablet, or computer. Your ideas are no longer trapped in one place but travel with you, ready to be explored or expanded at a moment\u0026rsquo;s notice.\nA Tool for Everyone\r#\rYou don\u0026rsquo;t need to be a tech expert to benefit from these digital tools. They\u0026rsquo;re designed to be intuitive, flexible, and adaptable to your unique way of thinking. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a student, professional, creative, or simply someone who loves collecting ideas, there\u0026rsquo;s a solution that can work for you.\nThe Power of Community\r#\rWhat makes these tools truly special is the community behind them. Imagine thousands of people around the world sharing clever ways to organize information, creating tools that make capturing and connecting ideas easier and more fun.\nYour Digital Journey Begins\r#\rYour collection of thoughts, ideas, and memories is unique ‚Äì as individual as your fingerprint.

This fostered innovation and responsiveness, unlike authoritarian regimes that struggled with information control. However, AI introduces a critical shift, creating powerful centralizing forces that threaten this balance.\nData is Power\r#\rAI thrives on vast datasets, giving immense power to those who control them‚Äîgovernments and large corporations. This data concentration can undermine the decentralized information crucial for democracy, creating an uneven playing field where a few hold significant sway.\nAlgorithmic Control\r#\rAI algorithms can subtly manipulate populations through personalized information feeds, targeted advertising, and the spread of misinformation. This makes informed choices harder for citizens, eroding the foundation of democratic decision-making.\nErosion of Trust\r#\rAs AI sophistication increases, distinguishing real from fake information becomes increasingly difficult. This can lead to a general erosion of trust in institutions, the media, and even interpersonal relationships, fostering social and political instability.\nAI‚Äôs Power to Unite and Divide\r#\rAI is more than just a technological advancement; it is a force that can shape reality itself. As Harari argues in Nexus, information is not neutral‚Äîit has always been used to unite, organize, and sometimes control societies. Today, AI-driven misinformation threatens democracy by distorting public perception and eroding trust. To combat this, the United States and other global leaders must implement regulations to curb AI-driven manipulation and promote digital literacy, transforming AI into a tool for cohesion rather than division. Balancing Innovation and Ethical Responsibility\r#\rThe rapid expansion of AI must be paired with ethical oversight. Harari warns that in the pursuit of efficiency and profitability, AI risks entrenching biases, deepening inequalities, and making opaque decisions that lack accountability. Governments, corporations, and technologists must collaborate to create frameworks ensuring AI operates fairly, transparently, and in service of humanity‚Äôs well-being. Just as wounds can be sites of learning and transformation, the mistakes AI has already made should guide us toward more ethical development. AI as a Tool for Self-Correction\r#\rHarari emphasizes that AI has the power to amplify both the best and worst aspects of human nature. If left unchecked, it can be a tool for authoritarian control and mass surveillance. However, when harnessed responsibly, it can enhance creativity, mitigate biases, and support informed decision-making. Imagine AI being used to counter misinformation in real time, ensure fair hiring practices, and help individuals build knowledge networks. The key is in designing AI that prioritizes truth, accountability, and the betterment of society.\nCan Democracy Survive?\r#\rHarari doesn\u0026rsquo;t offer easy answers, but suggests democracy\u0026rsquo;s survival depends on addressing these challenges:\nTransparency and Accountability: Demanding transparency in AI system usage, particularly those influencing public discourse. Who owns the data? What are the algorithms designed to do? How are they used? Regulation: Carefully balancing regulation to prevent AI manipulation without stifling innovation. Education and Critical Thinking: Educating citizens about AI\u0026rsquo;s potential dangers and equipping them with critical thinking skills for the age of algorithms. Media literacy is crucial. Decentralization: Exploring ways to decentralize AI power through open-source technologies and diverse AI ecosystems. A Future Shaped by Choice\r#\rHarari‚Äôs insights remind us that AI is not inherently good or bad‚Äîit is a tool that will shape the world according to the values we embed within it. If allowed to develop without ethical guardrails, AI risks creating a world where truth is malleable, power is centralized, and human agency is diminished. But if we take proactive steps, we can turn this moment of uncertainty into one of enlightenment. As Rumi suggests, our wounds‚Äîour fears and vulnerabilities regarding AI‚Äîcan become the very source of our strength, guiding us toward a future where AI serves humanity rather than subjugates it. The time to act is now, ensuring AI‚Äôs light shines in ways that elevate, rather than diminish, our collective human experience. The stakes are high. The future of democracy may well depend on it.\n\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-11-Tuesday]] | [[2025-02-14-Friday]] \u0026raquo;\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/journal/2025-02-14-friday/","title":"2025 02 14 Friday","section":"Journal","content":"\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-12-Wednesday]] | [[2025-02-19-Wednesday]] \u0026raquo;\nAI Writing\r#\rShine On: Embracing Your Value and Contributing to the World\r#\r[!quote] Yeah we all shine on, like the moon, and the stars, and the sun. ‚Äî John Lennon\nIn the quiet moments of reflection, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to question our worth and the impact we can have on the world.

This digital repository, often managed through tools like Obsidian, promises to enhance productivity and creativity by externalizing our mental processes. However, a critical question arises: Is the use of a second brain merely an avoidant behavior that facilitates procrastination, or does it genuinely lay the groundwork for a robust knowledge foundation that yields long-term benefits?\nThe Procrastination Perspective\r#\rFor some, the meticulous organization of notes and ideas can become an elaborate form of procrastination. The act of setting up a second brain might serve as a distraction from immediate tasks, offering a false sense of productivity. This behavior aligns with the tendency to engage in low-priority activities to avoid more pressing responsibilities. The allure of perfecting a digital system can overshadow the actual application of the knowledge it contains, leading to a cycle where the tool becomes an end in itself rather than a means to an end.\nBuilding a Knowledge Foundation\r#\rConversely, when used effectively, a second brain can be a powerful tool for building a comprehensive knowledge foundation. By capturing and connecting disparate pieces of information, individuals can create a personal web of knowledge that supports deeper understanding and innovation. This system allows for the synthesis of ideas across different domains, fostering creativity and problem-solving. Over time, the accumulated insights and connections can lead to significant breakthroughs, both personally and professionally.\nStriking a Balance\r#\rThe key to leveraging a second brain lies in striking a balance between organization and action. It\u0026rsquo;s essential to ensure that the time spent managing the system does not outweigh the benefits it provides. Regularly reviewing and applying the stored information can prevent the tool from becoming a procrastination crutch. Additionally, setting clear goals and priorities can help maintain focus on the primary purpose of the second brain: to enhance productivity and facilitate meaningful work.\nConclusion\r#\rUltimately, whether a second brain serves as a procrastination tool or a knowledge foundation depends on how it is used. By consciously integrating it into daily routines and aligning it with personal and professional objectives, individuals can harness its potential to support long-term growth and achievement. The second brain should be a dynamic resource that evolves with its user, continually contributing to a deeper understanding of the world and oneself.\n\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-14-Friday]] | [[2025-02-20-Thursday]] \u0026raquo;\n"},{"id":12,"href":"/journal/2025-02-20-thursday/","title":"2025 02 20 Thursday","section":"Journal","content":"\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-19-Wednesday]] | [[2025-02-23-Sunday]] \u0026raquo;\nAI Writing\r#\rEmbrace Positivity: A Path to a Fulfilling Life\r#\r[!quote] Learn to listen. Opportunity could be knocking at your door very softly. ‚Äî Frank Tyger\nIn a world where stress and anxiety seem to be the norm, the simple act of smiling can feel like a revolutionary act. Studies have shown that a positive outlook can increase lifespan by up to 35%. But is it really that simple? This essay explores the science-backed benefits of positivity, offering practical strategies to cultivate a more optimistic mindset and illustrating how a positive attitude can transform not only your own life but also the lives of those around you.\nThe Science of Positivity\r#\rResearch has consistently demonstrated the profound impact of positive thinking on health. For example, a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that optimists had a 77% lower risk of heart disease. Positivity affects the body by reducing the production of stress hormones like cortisol, which can weaken the immune system and increase inflammation. Furthermore, positive emotions trigger the release of endorphins, natural mood boosters that alleviate pain and promote a sense of well-being.\nCultivating a Positive Mindset\r#\rCultivating positivity requires conscious effort and consistent practice. Here are some actionable strategies:\nGratitude Practice: Start a gratitude journal and write down three things you\u0026rsquo;re grateful for each day. Be specific ‚Äì instead of \u0026ldquo;my family,\u0026rdquo; write \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m grateful for my sister\u0026rsquo;s supportive phone calls.\u0026rdquo;\nMindfulness and Meditation: Use apps like Headspace or Calm to guide you through daily meditation sessions. Even five minutes a day can significantly reduce negative thinking.\nSurrounding Yourself with Positivity: Limit your exposure to negative news and social media content. Seek out friends and mentors who radiate positivity and inspire you to be your best self.\nPositive Self-Talk: When you catch yourself thinking negatively, challenge those thoughts. For example, if you think, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to fail this presentation,\u0026rdquo; reframe it as, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m well-prepared, and I can handle this.\u0026rdquo;\nSetting Achievable Goals: Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Achieving these small goals will provide a sense of accomplishment and boost your confidence.\nPracticing Self-Compassion: Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend. Acknowledge your imperfections and celebrate your strengths.\nEngaging in Activities That Bring Joy: Make time for hobbies and activities that you genuinely enjoy, whether it\u0026rsquo;s painting, hiking, or spending time with loved ones.\nThe Ripple Effect of Positivity\r#\rPositivity is remarkably contagious. Consider the story of a hospital janitor who always greeted patients with a smile and a kind word. His positive attitude not only brightened their day but also improved their overall experience, leading to better patient satisfaction scores. Similarly, a positive team leader can inspire their colleagues to work more collaboratively and creatively, resulting in higher productivity and a more positive work environment.\nOvercoming Obstacles with Positivity\r#\rLife\u0026rsquo;s challenges are inevitable, but a positive mindset can transform obstacles into opportunities for growth. Take the example of J.K. Rowling, who faced numerous rejections before her Harry Potter series became a global phenomenon. Her ability to maintain a positive outlook and persevere despite setbacks was crucial to her success. By viewing setbacks as temporary and surmountable, you can maintain motivation and achieve your goals.\nAddressing Counterarguments\r#\rIt\u0026rsquo;s important to acknowledge that positivity is not about ignoring negative emotions or pretending that everything is perfect. It\u0026rsquo;s about approaching challenges with a balanced perspective and recognizing that difficult emotions are a natural part of life. Emotional intelligence involves understanding and managing your emotions, as well as empathizing with others. It\u0026rsquo;s also worth noting that excessive positivity can be unrealistic or dismissive of genuine struggles. The key is to find a balance between optimism and realism, allowing yourself to feel and process negative emotions while maintaining a hopeful outlook.\nConclusion\r#\rEmbracing positivity is a powerful choice that can transform your life and the lives of those around you. By incorporating the strategies outlined in this essay, you can cultivate a more optimistic mindset, enhance your well-being, and navigate life\u0026rsquo;s challenges with greater resilience. So, take a deep breath, find something to smile about, and start spreading the positivity today. Your future self will thank you for it.\n\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-19-Wednesday]] | [[2025-02-23-Sunday]] \u0026raquo;\n"},{"id":13,"href":"/journal/2025-02-23-sunday/","title":"2025 02 23 Sunday","section":"Journal","content":"\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-20-Thursday]] | [[2025-02-24-Monday]] \u0026raquo;\nAI Writing\r#\rResilience and Hope: A Global Perspective on Positive Well-being\r#\r[!quote] Hope is an ontological need. ‚Äî Paulo Freire\nIntroduction: The Complexity of Human Optimism\r#\rIn the remote highlands of Bhutan and the bustling streets of S√£o Paulo, in the quiet meditation halls of Kyoto and the vibrant communities of rural Africa, human beings share a remarkable capacity: the ability to find hope in challenging circumstances. This essay explores the multifaceted nature of positivity, moving beyond simplistic self-help narratives to understand how different cultures cultivate resilience and emotional well-being.\nThe Anthropology of Hope\r#\rPositivity is not a universal, one-size-fits-all concept, but a complex cultural adaptation shaped by historical, social, and environmental contexts.

To realize one\u0026rsquo;s nature perfectly ‚Äì that is what each of us is here for. ‚Äî Oscar Wilde\nWe often find ourselves caught in the whirlwind of daily life, chasing external achievements and societal expectations. Yet, Oscar Wilde\u0026rsquo;s profound words remind us that the true purpose of existence lies within: the continuous journey of self-development.

It often requires confronting our weaknesses, overcoming challenges, and stepping outside our comfort zones. As Rumi\u0026rsquo;s quote in [[2025-02-12-Wednesday]] suggests, \u0026ldquo;The wound is the place where the Light enters you.\u0026rdquo; It is through these struggles that we grow stronger, more resilient, and more compassionate. By embracing our vulnerabilities and learning from our mistakes, we transform our \u0026ldquo;wounds\u0026rdquo; into sources of wisdom and strength.\nThe Ripple Effect of Self-Improvement\r#\rThe benefits of self-development extend far beyond the individual. As we grow and evolve, we become better equipped to contribute to our communities, our workplaces, and the world at large. A person who is self-aware, confident, and skilled is more likely to be a positive influence on those around them. As [[2025-02-20-Thursday]] suggests, positivity is contagious, and by cultivating our own inner well-being, we create a ripple effect that inspires and uplifts others.\nThe Ethical Imperative of Self-Development\r#\rIn an increasingly complex and interconnected world, self-development is not just a personal choice, but an ethical imperative. As discussed in [[2025-02-12-Wednesday]], AI has the potential to be both a powerful force for good and a tool for manipulation. It is our responsibility to develop our critical thinking skills, our ethical awareness, and our capacity for empathy so that we can navigate these challenges and contribute to a more just and equitable world.\nEmbracing Your Inner Light\r#\rUltimately, self-development is about realizing our full potential and embracing our unique \u0026ldquo;light,\u0026rdquo; as John Lennon\u0026rsquo;s quote in [[2025-02-14-Friday]] reminds us. It\u0026rsquo;s about recognizing that we each have something valuable to offer the world and committing to the ongoing process of becoming the best version of ourselves.\nConclusion\r#\rOscar Wilde\u0026rsquo;s words serve as a timeless reminder that the aim of life is not simply to exist, but to thrive, to grow, and to become the masterpiece we were always meant to be. By embracing self-development, we unlock our potential, enrich our lives, and contribute to a brighter future for all. So, let us embark on this journey of self-discovery with courage, curiosity, and a unwavering commitment to realizing our true nature.\n\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-23-Sunday]] | [[2025-02-25-Tuesday]] \u0026raquo;\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/journal/2025-02-25-tuesday/","title":"2025 02 25 Tuesday","section":"Journal","content":"\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-24-Monday]] | [[2025-02-26-Wednesday]] \u0026raquo;\nAI Writing\r#\rThe Wellspring of Compassion: Why Self-Love is Essential for Loving Others\r#\r[!quote] Genuine love should first be directed at oneself; if we do not love ourselves, how can we love others? ‚Äî Dalai Lama\nIn a world often focused on external achievements and relationships, the Dalai Lama\u0026rsquo;s words serve as a profound reminder: genuine love begins within. This essay explores the idea that self-love is not a selfish indulgence, but a foundational requirement for truly loving and connecting with others. Drawing upon previous discussions about resilience, positivity, and personal growth, it argues that cultivating self-compassion is essential for building meaningful relationships and contributing positively to the world.\nThe Foundation of Genuine Connection\r#\rThe Dalai Lama\u0026rsquo;s quote challenges the common notion that love is solely an outward expression. It suggests that our capacity to love others is directly proportional to the love we hold for ourselves. If we are filled with self-doubt, criticism, and negativity, these emotions will inevitably color our interactions with others. As explored in [[2025-02-20-Thursday]], positivity is contagious, but so is negativity. Therefore, cultivating self-love is not merely a personal benefit, but a way to ensure that our interactions with others are rooted in genuine care and compassion.\nOvercoming the \u0026ldquo;Wound\u0026rdquo; Through Self-Compassion\r#\rSelf-love is not about arrogance or self-admiration; it\u0026rsquo;s about self-acceptance and self-compassion. It involves treating ourselves with the same kindness and understanding that we would offer a friend. As Rumi\u0026rsquo;s quote in [[2025-02-12-Wednesday]] suggests, \u0026ldquo;The wound is the place where the Light enters you.\u0026rdquo; By embracing our vulnerabilities and imperfections, we open ourselves to growth and transformation. Self-compassion allows us to heal our \u0026ldquo;wounds\u0026rdquo; and emerge stronger, more resilient, and more capable of loving others unconditionally.\nThe Ripple Effect of Self-Love\r#\rWhen we cultivate self-love, we create a ripple effect that extends to all areas of our lives. We become more confident, more authentic, and more capable of pursuing our goals. As discussed in [[2025-02-14-Friday]], embracing our value and contributing to the world starts with recognizing our own inherent worth. When we love ourselves, we are more likely to take care of our physical and emotional well-being, leading to a healthier and more fulfilling life. This, in turn, allows us to be more present and supportive in our relationships with others.\nThe Ethical Imperative of Self-Love\r#\rIn an increasingly interconnected world, self-love is not just a personal choice, but an ethical imperative. As discussed in [[2025-02-12-Wednesday]], AI has the potential to be both a powerful force for good and a tool for manipulation. Similarly, our capacity for love can be used to uplift and empower others, or to manipulate and control them. By cultivating self-love, we ensure that our actions are motivated by genuine compassion and a desire to create a more just and equitable world.\nPractical Steps to Cultivate Self-Love\r#\rCultivating self-love is an ongoing process that requires conscious effort and consistent practice. Here are some actionable strategies:\nPractice Self-Compassion: Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend. Challenge Negative Self-Talk: Identify and challenge negative thoughts and replace them with positive affirmations. Set Boundaries: Learn to say no to requests that drain your energy or compromise your values. Engage in Activities That Bring Joy: Make time for hobbies and activities that you genuinely enjoy. Practice Gratitude: Focus on the things you appreciate about yourself and your life. Seek Support: Connect with friends, family, or a therapist who can provide support and guidance. Conclusion\r#\rThe Dalai Lama\u0026rsquo;s words offer a profound insight into the nature of love. By prioritizing self-love, we not only enhance our own well-being but also cultivate the capacity for genuine connection and compassion with others. Let us embark on this journey of self-discovery with courage, curiosity, and a unwavering commitment to realizing our true nature. By embracing self-love, we unlock our potential to create a more loving and compassionate world for all.\n\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-24-Monday]] | [[2025-02-26-Wednesday]] \u0026raquo;\n"},{"id":16,"href":"/journal/2025-02-26-wednesday/","title":"2025 02 26 Wednesday","section":"Journal","content":"\u0026laquo; [[2025-02-25-Tuesday]] | [[2025-02-27-Thursday]] \u0026raquo;\nAI Writing\r#\rThe Struggle for Flow: Finding Center in Overwhelming Times\r#\r[!quote] Flow with whatever is happening and let your mind be free.

Project Setup \u0026amp; Configuration\nInstall Hugo: Download and install the Hugo static site generator. Follow the instructions for your operating system on the official Hugo website. Create a New Hugo Site: Use the Hugo CLI to create a new site: hugo new site your-site-name. This will create a basic directory structure for your Hugo project. Configure Hugo: Edit the config.toml (or config.yaml or config.json) file in the root of your Hugo project. Configure basic site settings like baseURL and title. Since we\u0026rsquo;re not using a theme, we\u0026rsquo;ll need to handle all styling ourselves. We\u0026rsquo;ll configure Hugo to output the bare minimum HTML structure. Set up Obsidian Vault: Create or designate an Obsidian vault to hold your website content. II. Content Creation in Obsidian\nWrite Content in Markdown: Create your website content as Markdown files within your Obsidian vault.\nUse Frontmatter: Add frontmatter to your Markdown files to define metadata like title, date, categories, tags, and any other custom fields. Example:\n--- title: \u0026#34;My First Post\u0026#34; date: 2023-10-27 categories: [\u0026#34;blog\u0026#34;] tags: [\u0026#34;hugo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;obsidian\u0026#34;] --- This is the content of my first post. Organize Content: Organize your content within your Obsidian vault in a way that makes sense for your website\u0026rsquo;s structure. Consider using subfolders for different sections or categories.\nHandle Images and Assets: Store images and other assets in a dedicated directory within your Obsidian vault (e.g., assets). Link to these assets in your Markdown files using relative paths. For example: ![My Image](assets/my-image.png).\nIII. Integrating Obsidian with Hugo\nLink Obsidian Vault to Hugo: Decide how you will make your Obsidian content accessible to Hugo. There are a few options:\nOption 1: Directly within Hugo: Place your Obsidian vault (or a subset of it) directly within the content directory of your Hugo project. This is the simplest approach if you want Hugo to directly process your Obsidian Markdown files. Option 2: Symbolic Links: Create symbolic links from your Hugo content directory to the relevant directories within your Obsidian vault. This allows you to keep your Obsidian vault separate from your Hugo project while still making the content accessible to Hugo. Option 3: Scripted Copying: Write a script (e.g., using Python or Bash) to copy the relevant Markdown files from your Obsidian vault to the Hugo content directory. This gives you more control over the copying process and allows you to perform transformations on the content if needed. Configure Hugo to Process Markdown: Ensure that Hugo is configured to correctly process your Markdown files, including frontmatter and any Obsidian-specific syntax. You may need to adjust your Hugo configuration or use a custom Markdown renderer to handle certain Obsidian features. Since we\u0026rsquo;re not using a theme, this will involve creating custom layouts and templates.\nIV. Building and Deploying the Site with AWS Microservices\nBuild the Site: Run the hugo command in the root of your Hugo project to generate the static website files. This will create a public directory containing the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets for your site. AWS Setup: S3 Bucket: Create an S3 bucket to store your static website files (the contents of the public directory). Configure the bucket for static website hosting. CloudFront Distribution: Create a CloudFront distribution to serve your website content from the S3 bucket. This will provide caching and improve performance. Configure the CloudFront distribution to point to your S3 bucket. (Optional) API Gateway \u0026amp; Lambda: If you need any dynamic functionality (e.g., contact forms, search), you can create API endpoints using API Gateway and Lambda functions. These functions can interact with other AWS services like DynamoDB. Deployment: Upload to S3: Upload the contents of the public directory to your S3 bucket. You can use the AWS CLI or the AWS Management Console to do this. Invalidate CloudFront Cache: After uploading the files, invalidate the CloudFront cache to ensure that the latest version of your website is served to users. Domain Configuration: Configure your domain name to point to your CloudFront distribution. This will allow users to access your website using your domain name. V. Custom Styling and Layout (Since No Theme)\nCreate Custom Layouts: You\u0026rsquo;ll need to create custom layouts in the layouts directory of your Hugo project. This will involve creating HTML templates for your homepage, single pages, list pages, etc. Add Custom CSS: Create a static/css directory and add your custom CSS files to style your website. Link these CSS files in your HTML layouts. Consider a CSS Framework: To speed up development, consider using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS. You can include these frameworks in your project and use their classes to style your website. Hugo Pipes: Use Hugo Pipes to manage and process your CSS and JavaScript assets. This allows you to minify, concatenate, and transpile your assets for better performance. VI. Advanced Considerations\nObsidian Plugins: Consider using Obsidian plugins to enhance your content creation workflow. For example, you could use a plugin to automatically generate frontmatter or to export your notes in a format suitable for Hugo. Hugo Shortcodes: Use Hugo shortcodes to add dynamic content and functionality to your website. You can create custom shortcodes to embed videos, display data, or perform other tasks. Automated Deployment: Set up automated deployment using a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI). This will automatically build and deploy your website whenever you make changes to your Obsidian vault or Hugo project. You can configure your CI/CD pipeline to build your Hugo site and upload the contents of the public directory to your S3 bucket, then invalidate the CloudFront cache. This revised plan focuses on using AWS microservices for hosting and serving your website and eliminates the need for a pre-built theme. It emphasizes the need for custom layouts and styling.
